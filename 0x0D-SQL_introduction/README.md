## Tasks

### Task 1: List All in Table
**Description:** Write a script to list all records in the `first_table` of the `hbtn_0c_0` database.

### Task 2: First Table
**Description:** Write a script to create a new table named `second_table` in the `hbtn_0c_0` database.

### Task 3: Full Description
**Description:** Write a script to retrieve the full description of the `second_table` in the `hbtn_0c_0` database.

### Task 4: List by best
**Description:** Write a script to list all records of the `second_table` of the `hbtn_0c_0` database. Results should display both the score and the name, and records should be ordered by score (highest first).

### Task 5: No table for a meeting
**Description:** Write a script to create an empty table named `first_table` in the `hbtn_0c_0` database.

### Task 6: Change My Name
**Description:** Write a script to update the name field of the record with an `id` of 2 in the `second_table` of the `hbtn_0c_0` database.

### Task 7: 100-Replace
**Description:** Write a script that replaces the name field for all records in the `second_table` with the value `New name` in the `hbtn_0c_0` database.

### Task 8: Delete by Id
**Description:** Write a script to delete the record with an `id` of 3 in the `second_table` of the `hbtn_0c_0` database.

### Task 9: Twitter me
**Description:** Write a script to create a new record in the `second_table` of the `hbtn_0c_0` database with a score of 10 and the name 'Twitter'.

### Task 10: Top Score
**Description:** Write a script to list all records of the `second_table` of the `hbtn_0c_0` database. Results should display both the score and the name, and records should be ordered by score (highest first).

### Task 11: Select the best
**Description:** Write a script to list all records with a score >= 10 in the `second_table` of the `hbtn_0c_0` database. Results should display both the score and the name, and records should be ordered by score (highest first).

### Task 12: Cheating is bad
**Description:** Write a script to update the score of Bob to 10 in the `second_table`. You are not allowed to use Bob's id value, only the name field.

### Task 14: Average
**Description:** Write a script to compute the score average of all records in the `second_table` of the `hbtn_0c_0` database.

### Task 15: Number by Score
**Description:** Write a script to list the number of records with the same score in the `second_table` of the `hbtn_0c_0` database. Results should display the score and the number of records, sorted by the number of records (descending).

### Task 16: Say My Name
**Description:** Write a script to list all records of the `second_table` of the `hbtn_0c_0` database. Don't list rows without a name value, and list records by descending score.

### Task 17: Go to UTF8 (Advanced)
**Description:** Write a script to convert the `hbtn_0c_0` database, `first_table`, and the `name` field in `first_table` to UTF8 (utf8mb4, collate utf8mb4_unicode_ci).

### Task 18: Temperatures #0 (Advanced)
**Description:** Write a script to display the average temperature (Fahrenheit) by city ordered by temperature (descending).

### Task 19: Temperatures #1 (Advanced)
**Description:** Write a script to display the top 3 cities with the highest average temperature during July and August, ordered by temperature (descending).

### Task 20: Temperatures #2 (Advanced)
**Description:** Write a script to display the maximum temperature of each state, ordered by state name.

## Getting Started

To execute the SQL scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a MySQL server installed.

2. Import the provided table dump (`temperatures`) into the `hbtn_0c_0` database. You can use the MySQL `source` command to import the dump.

3. Use the MySQL command-line client to run the SQL scripts. For example:

   ```bash
   cat 101-avg_temperatures.sql | mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -p hbtn_0c_0
   ```

   Replace the script name and database name as needed.

## Usage

Each task has its own SQL script file (e.g., `101-avg_temperatures.sql`). You can run these scripts to perform the specified database operations.
